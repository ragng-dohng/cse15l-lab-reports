In enrolling in CSE 15L, the UCSD server automatically creates a directory for each student. You need to get the specifier associated with that directory. It will look like this: cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu where zzz will be unique to you. This will allow remote connection to a computer in the CSE basement
