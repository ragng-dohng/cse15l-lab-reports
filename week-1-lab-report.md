# Week 1 â€“ Markdown, URLs, Paths, and the Filesystem

In enrolling in CSE 15L, the UCSD server automatically creates a directory for each student. You need to get the specifier associated with that directory: <mark>cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu</mark> where zzz will be unique to you. This will allow remote connection to a computer in the CSE basement

### Step 1. Course-Specific Account on ieng6
1. Go to this [web](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
2. System (arbitrarily) requires you to [change password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit). The current password refers to your school password.
3. Note your <mark>cs15lwi23zzz</mark>
### Step 2. Install VScode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
(the VScode environment should look like the below)
![VScode](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/images/vscode.png)
### Step 3. Remotely Connecting
1. MAC automatically have git. If Windows, install git [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. [Set the default terminal](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) in VScode to the installed git bash
3. In your VScode terminal, type <mark>$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu</mark> and ENTER
(don't include the $ which is used to denote terminal commands)
4. The terminal will ask for your password next. Note: when you're typing the password, it will not be displayed to screen.
![login]()

8. Type <mark>yes</mark> and ENTER when asked if you want to continue connecting
