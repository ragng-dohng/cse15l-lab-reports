# Lab Report 2 - Servers and Bugs

### Part 1 WebServers
`StringServer` displays all, including previous, incoming string requests, each on a newline, since the start of the server.
- start server with following java commands to launch the server locally (ctrl-C to stop the server from running)

- incoming string request form: `/add-message?s=<string>`
- code for the server as follows:
    ```java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.URI;
    import java.util.ArrayList;

    class Handler implements URLHandler {
        // The one bit of state on the server: a number that will be manipulated by
        // various requests.
        ArrayList<String> str_list = new ArrayList<String>();

        public String handleRequest(URI url) {
            if (url.getPath().equals("/")) {
                return String.format("Linhsan's String Server");
            } 
            else {
                System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
                if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {
                    String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
                    if (parameters[0].equals("s")) {
                        str_list.add(parameters[1]);
                    }
                    String result = "";
                    for(String element:str_list) {
                        result += element + "\n";
                    }
                    return result;
                }
            }
            return "404 Not Found!";
        }
    }

    class StringServer {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            if(args.length == 0){
                System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
                return;
            }

            int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

            Server.start(port, new Handler());
        }
    }
    ```
- examples of output:

    ![screenshot-1](screenshot-1.png)
    
    - When the first string request `http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=my%20name` comes in, the `handleRequest()` method is called taking in the url `new URI("http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=my%20name")`. 
    - The ArrayList 'str_list', initially empty, now has has its first element as parameter[1], extracted via `url.getQuery().split("=")` and the nested-if condition. 
    - Note that the `url.getQuery()` extracts the part that follows the `?` (the query component) of the url and then the `split("=")` method splits into substrings whatever is separated by the `=`. 
    - In addition, because space characters are not allowed in urls, the path was auto-filled with the url-encoding for the space character `%20`, so that "my name" is interpreted as a single string. 

    ![screenshot-2](screenshot-2.png)
    
    - Similarly, the next string request `http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=is%20Linhsan` has `handlerequest()` with `new URI("http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=is%20Linhsan")` as input. 
    - The ArrayList `str_list` now has two elements: ["my name","is Linhsan"]. All the elements of `str_list` is concatenated, each separated by a newline, in the variable `result` to be returned as a single output.

### Part 2 Unit Testing Buggy Programs
Here's a buggy program:
```java
public class ArrayExamples {

  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
}
```
(java command to run JUnit test for Windows)
```
$ javac -cp ".;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar" *.java
$ java -cp ".;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests
```
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program:
    
    (JUnit test)
    ```java
    public class ArrayTests {
      @Test
      public void testReverseInPlace2() {
        int[] input = {1,2,3,4};
        ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{4,3,2,1}, input);
      }
    }
    ```
    symptom
    - expected: [4,3,2,1]
    - actual: [4,3,3,4]
    - JUnit output:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111631103/217134586-00ccd4e5-0855-45f6-95d4-eee0f9d124c8.png)

- The following input doesnâ€™t induce a failure:

    (JUnit Test)
    ```java
    public class ArrayTests {
        @Test 
        public void testReverseInPlace1() {
        int[] input = { 3 };
        ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input);
        }
    }
    ```
    symptom
    - expected: [3]
    - actual: [3]
    - JUnit output:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111631103/217133982-e2a1edbb-dfbc-4143-b378-93656f343e06.png)

- Code after fixing bug:
    ```java
    public class ArrayExamples {

      // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
      static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
        for(int i = 0; i < (arr.length/2); i += 1) {
          int temp = arr[i];
          arr[i] = arr[arr.length-i-1];
          arr[arr.length-i-1] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    - The original program with the bug didn't induce any failures when tested with an array with of one element as reversing an one element array always results in the same array. However, when the array has a length greater than one, we see that the test failed. The original program is re-assigning the values in the first half with its latter half while the latter half, similarly, is re-assigned values from the first half **but** this first half has already been overwritten with the values of the latter half. Essentially, the first half losts its initial values which it was supposed to pass onto the second half, e.g. [a,b,c,d] => [c,d,d,c]. We can fix this by storing the to-be swapped value beforehand and then swap the two corresponding elements at once (versus in sequential order), so the variable temp would hold the value `a` while "a's spot" is re-assigned the value `d`. Then, "d's spot" is assigned the value "a" which temp was holding, and this continues on until the 

### Part 3 Some Afterthoughts
